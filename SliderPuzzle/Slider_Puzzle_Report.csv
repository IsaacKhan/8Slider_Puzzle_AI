Why the differences in Depth across each search?,,,,,,,
"Well, each solution except for DFS are looking for a path. DFS is looking for a solution. 
The difference also comes down to how each algorithm functions.
For DFS, it goes down a single path until it hits a wall. That explains why it's depth is so large.
For the other three, their depth is practially the same.
That is because they all have the same structure, but with minor variation in the code.
Those variations show in the other noted attributes.",,,,,,,

Why the differnces in the Node Count across each search?,,,,,,,
"DFS has the greatest Node count because, again, it barrels down a single path before looking
any other options. Next is the BFS. This is to be expected since there is some direction for 
the algorithm. For our two A* searches, Misplaced Tiles takes the second best Node Count and 
Manhattan Distance takes home the gold. Both of these searches use a heuristic. MT is a simple heuristic while MD is a bit more thoughtful.",,,,,,,

Why the difference in the Time across each search?,,,,,,,
"Oddly, BFS and DFS average times are about the same. Typically, a BFS would be faster than DFS,
and in the data BFS is faster. The slight difference could be chalked up to states that could be 
quickly solved with DFS methods. MT and MD are the two fastest. This, again, is because of their 
heuristics. If I hadn't included the No Solution Data sets, these two algorithms' Time would be 
significantly lower than what is seen here.",,,,,,,
